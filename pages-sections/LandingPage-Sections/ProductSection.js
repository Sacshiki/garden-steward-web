            After starting a garden in a high pedestrian traffic hill in Oakland California I noticed that there were a lot of people that wanted to get involved, but I didn't have a good solution on how to put them to work. This is the solution on getting volunteers educated and organized to make sure things can be accomplished without the oversite and time commitment it would otherwise require.
